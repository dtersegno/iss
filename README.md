to do:

- look for changes in gravity due to anomaly
- look for changes in gravity due to ellipsoid correction
- ditto for moon


- ~~get lots more data, and fill in missing regions (you can see in the speed plots)
- verify phase and rotation of earth with X, Y, Z


- what are the easy great circles to cross on the earth?
- what are the hard great circles to cross on the earth?
    - width 5 miles? less?
